# SynthLimitOrder Contracts Spec
*NOTES*:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.25` (or above)
 - In order for these contracts to be able to access user SNX tokens, they must approve the proxy contract address for each token individually using the ERC20 approve() function. We recommend a max uint (2^256 - 1) approval amount.

*Order of deployment*:
 1. The `Implementation` contract is deployed
 2. The `ImplementationResolver` contract is deployed where the address of the `Implementation` contract is provided to the constructor as an `initialImplementation`
 3. The `Proxy` contract is deployed with the address of the `ImplementationResolver` where the address of the `ImplementationResolver` is provided to the constructor.
 4. The `StateStorage` contract is deployed where the address of the `Proxy` contract is provided the constructor as a `proxyContract`

## Implementation Contract

The Implementation contract stores no state and no funds and is never called directly by users. It is meant to only receive forwarded contract calls from the Proxy contract.

All state read and write operations of this contract must be sent to the `StateStorage` contract instead of being added or queried from the local state.

### Methods

#### newOrder

``` js
function newOrder(bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, uint sourceAmount, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey, uint minDestinationAmount, uint executionFee) public returns (uint orderID);
```

This function allows a `msg.sender` who has already given the `Proxy` contract an allowance of `sourceCurrencyKey` to submit a new limit order.

1. Transfers `sourceAmount` of the `sourceCurrencyKey` Synth from the `msg.sender` to this contract via `transferFrom`.
2. Adds a new limit order using `StateStorage.createOrder()` that can only execute on Synthetix exchange if the returned destination amount is more than or equal to `minDestinationAmount`. The order's `executed` property is set to `false`.
3. Requires a deposited `msg.value` to be more than the `executionFee` in order to refund node operators for their exact gas wei cost in addition to the `executionFee` amount. The remainder will be transferred back to the user at the end of the trade.
4. Emits an `Order` event for node operators including order data and `orderID`.
5. Returns the `orderID`.

#### cancelOrder

``` js
function cancelOrder(uint orderID) public;
```

This function cancels a previously submitted and unexecuted order by the same `msg.sender` of the input `orderID`.

1. Requires the order `submitter` property to be equal to `msg.sender` using `StateStorage.getOrder()`
2. Requires the order `executed` property to be equal to be `false`.
3. Refunds the order's `sourceAmount` and deposited `msg.value`
4. Deletes the order using `StateStorage.deleteOrder()`
5. Emits a `Cancel` event for node operators including the `orderID`

#### executeOrder

``` js
function executeOrder(uint orderID) public;
```

This function allows a `msg.sender` who has an execualready given the `Proxy` contract an allowance of `sourceCurrencyKey` to submit a new limit order.

It fetches the order data using `StateStorage.getOrder()`, if the amount received is larger than or equal to the order's `minDestinationAmount`:

1. This transaction's submitter address is refunded for this transaction's gas cost + the `executionFee` amount from the user's wei deposit.
2. The remainder of the wei deposit is forwarded to the order submitter's address
3. The order's `executed` property is changed to `true`, the `executionTimestamp` property set to `block.timestamp` and `destinationAmount` set to the received amount using `StateStorage.setOrder()`
4. `Execute` event is emitted with the `orderID` for node operators 

If the amount received is smaller than the order's `minDestinationAmount`, the transaction reverts.

#### withdrawOrders

``` js
function withdrawOrders(uint[] orderID) public;
```

This function allows the sender to withdraw funds associated with an array of executed orders as soon as the Synthetix fee reclamation window for each of the order has elapsed.

It fetches each order's data using `StateStorage.getOrder()`, if each order's `submitter` is equal to `msg.sender`, has the `executed` property equal to `true` and `executionTimestamp + 3 minutes > block.timestamp`:

1. The `destinationAmount` of the `destinationCurrencyKey` is transferred to `msg.sender` using `Synth.transferAndSettle()`
2. The order is deleted using `StateStorage.deleteOrder()`
3. `Withdraw` event is emitted with the `orderID`.

#### getAllExecutableOrders

``` js
function getAllExecutableOrders() public view returns (uint256[] orderIDs);
```

This view function iterates over each `orderID` from 0 to `StateStorage.latestID` using `StateStorage.getOrder()` for each order and returns the IDs of all orders that are currently executable. An order is executable if its `minDestinationAmount` is larger than or equal to the amount receivable under the latest price published by the Synthetix oracle.

This utlity function is meant to be called by a Limit Order Execution Node on each new Ethereum block in order to collect new limit orders that can be immediately executed on this contract via the `executeOrder` function.

### Events

#### Order

``` js
event Order(uint indexed orderID, address indexed submitter, bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, uint sourceAmount, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey, uint minDestinationAmount uint executionFee, uint weiDeposit)
```

This event is emitted on each new submitted order. Its primary purpose is to alert node operators of newly submitted orders in realtime.

#### Cancel

``` js
event Cancel(uint indexed orderID);
```

This event is emitted on each cancelled order. Its primary purpose is to alert node operators that a previously submitted order should no longer be watched.

#### Execute

``` js
event Execute(uint indexed orderID, address executor);
```

This event is emitted on each successfully executed order. Its primary purpose is to alert node operators that a previously submitted order should no longer be watched.

#### Withdraw

``` js
event Withdraw(uint indexed orderID, address indexed submitter);
```

This event is emitted on each successfully withdrawn order.

## Proxy Contract
The proxy contract receives all incoming user transactions to its address and forwards them to the current implementation contract. It also holds all deposited token funds at all times including future upgrades.

All calls to this contract address must follow the ABI of the current `Implementation` contract.

### Constructor

```js
constructor(address ImplementationResolver) public;
```

The constructor sets the `ImplementationResolver` to an internal global variable to be accessed by the fallback function on each future contract call.

### Fallback function

```js
function() public;
```

Following any incoming contract call, the fallback function calls the `ImplementationResolver`'s `getImplementation()` function in order to query the address of the current `Implementation` contract and then uses `DELEGATECALL` opcode to forward the incoming contract call to the queried contract address.

---

## ImplementationResolver Contract

This contract provides the current `Implementation` contract address to the `Proxy` contract.
It is the only contract that is controlled by an `owner` address. It is also responsible for upgrading the current implementation address in case new features are to be added in the future.

### Constructor

```js
constructor(address initialImplementation, address initialOwner) public;
```

The constructor sets the `initialImplementation` address to an internal global variable to be access later by the `getImplementation()` method. It also sets the `initialOwner` address to the `owner` public global variable.

### Public Variables

#### owner

An address variable that stores the contract owner address responsible for upgrading the implementation contract address.

---

### Methods

#### changeOwnership

``` js
function changeOwnership(address newOwner) public;
```

This function allows only the current `owner` address to change the contract owner to a new address. It sets the `owner` global variable to the `newOwner` argument value and emits a `NewOwner` event.

#### upgrade

``` js
function upgrade(address newImplementation) public;
```

This function allows only the current `owner` address to upgrade the contract implementation address.

It sets the internal implementation global variable to the `newImplementation` global variable.

Following the upgrade, the `Upgraded` event is emitted.


## Events

#### NewOwner

``` js
event NewOwner(address newOwner);
```

This event is emitted when the contract `owner` address is changed.

#### Upgraded

``` js
event Upgraded(address newImplementation);
```

This event is emitted when `finalizeUpgrade()` is called.

---

## StateStorage Contract

This contract holds all limit orders state across different upgrades.

### Constructor

```js
constructor(address proxyContract, address synthetixContract, address exchangeRatesContract) public;
```

The constructor sets the `proxyContract` to an inteernal global variable. All future calls to this contract will be required to have their `msg.sender` be equal to this address.

It also sets th `synthetix` global variable to the `synthetixContract` argument and the `exchangeRates` global variable to `exchangeRatesContract`

### Structs

#### LimitOrder

```js
struct LimitOrder {
    address submitter;
    bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey;
    uint256 sourceAmount;
    bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey;
    uint256 minDestinationAmount;
    uint256 weiDeposit;
    uint256 executionFee;
    uint256 executionTimestamp;
    uint256 destinationAmount;
    bool executed;
}
```
All struct properties are required when an order is first created except `executionTimestamp` and `destinationAmount` which are only required after an order is executed. These two properties are left to their initial values (`0`) when the order is first created.


### Public Variables

#### latestID

A uin256 variable that tracks the highest orderID stored.

#### synthetix

An address variable that contains the address of the `Synthetix` exchange contract

#### exchangeRates

An address variable that contains the address of the Synthetix `ExchangeRates` contract

### Methods

#### setOrder

```js
function setOrder(uint orderID, address submitter, bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, uint sourceAmount, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey, uint minDestinationAmount, uint weiDeposit, uint executionFee, bool executed) public;
```

Overwrites an existing `LimitOrder` struct in the internal orders mapping where the key is `orderID`. This method is to be used for modifying existing orders only. If the `orderID` is larger than the `latestID` global variable, it reverts.

This method can only be called by the `Proxy` contract address, otherwise it reverts.

#### deleteOrder

```js
function deleteOrder(uint orderID) public;
```

Deletes an existing `LimitOrder` struct in the internal orders mapping where the key is `orderID`. If the `orderID` is larger than the `latestID` global variable, it reverts.

This method can only be called by the `Proxy` contract address, otherwise it reverts.

#### createOrder

```js
function createOrder(address submitter, bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, uint sourceAmount, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey, uint minDestinationAmount, uint weiDeposit, uint executionFee, bool executed) public returns (uint orderID)
```

Creates a new `LimitOrder` struct in the internal orders mapping where the `orderID` (the mapping key) is `latestID + 1` and returns the new `orderID`. It also globally increases the value of `latestID` by 1.

This method can only be called by the `Proxy` contract address, otherwise it reverts.

#### getOrder

```js
function getOrder(uint orderID) view public returns (address submitter, bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, uint sourceAmount, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey, uint minDestinationAmount, uint weiDeposit, uint executionFee, bool executed);
```

Returns an the values of a `LimitOrder` using the supplied `orderID` from the internal orders mapping.
